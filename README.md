# Loan Approval Risk Prediction Project

## Course: NLP (Semester 6) - Pillai College of Engineering

### Project Overview
Loan approval prediction is a crucial aspect of financial decision-making for banks and lending institutions. Automating this process using machine learning techniques helps reduce risks associated with loan defaults while ensuring fair and efficient approval mechanisms. The proposed system leverages historical loan data, applicant financial records, and credit scores to classify loan applications as either approved or denied.

## Project Abstract
Natural Language Processing (NLP) can play a pivotal role in automating loan application classification by analyzing unstructured financial and personal data. This study explores an NLP-based approach to classify loan applications as likely to be approved or denied by extracting meaningful insights from textual data such as financial history, credit reports, and applicant statements. By leveraging techniques like sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and text embeddings, the model enhances traditional credit assessment methods. Automating this process with NLP not only improves efficiency but also helps lenders make more informed and fair lending decisions while minimizing the risk of defaults.
