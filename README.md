## Project Abstract
In retail and e-commerce, product categorization is an essential operation that facilitates effective product arrangement and retrieval. The objective of this project is to use textual data—more especially, product descriptions and the categories that go with them—to create a machine learning-based model for product classification. The dataset contains two columns, namely, description and category. Tokenization, stopword elimination, and lemmatization are steps in the preprocessing pipeline that turn text into structured word arrays, which would be done on a “Description” labelled column. The right category for a particular product will then be predicted  through the best model by machine learning, deep learning or LLM. The suggested method improves product classification accuracy and automation, which benefits user experience and searchability.
